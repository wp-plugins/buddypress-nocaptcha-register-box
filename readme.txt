This super-lightweight plugin adds a Google's No Captcha human friendly reCAPTCHA box to the BuddyPress registration form.

== Description ==

This plugin obviously requires BuddyPress before it will do anything.

You also need to enter your API keys from Google in the settings page. You can choose light or dark theme and add basic CSS styling to the box.

It should help keep your community free from spammers and also hopefully not be too much of a inconvenience for your site's users. 

Based on Buddypress ReCaptacha by Hardeep Asrani.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to your 'wp-content/plugins' directory, or download and install automatically through your admin panel.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Configure reCAPTCHA settigns from Settings > BuddyPress Captcha menu.
